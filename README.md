# ANPR-
Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) using OpenCV is a robust system for detecting and recognizing license plates in images or video streams. It leverages OpenCV's image processing capabilities to identify the region of interest (license plate) through grayscale conversion, noise reduction, edge detection, and contour analysis. After isolating the plate region, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tools like Tesseract extract the alphanumeric characters from the image. This process often involves preprocessing steps such as thresholding and resizing to improve text recognition accuracy. For real-time applications, ANPR can be integrated with video feeds to continuously detect and display license plates. Advanced implementations may use deep learning models like YOLO or SSD for more accurate plate detection and segmentation, especially for obscured or non-standard plates. Enhancements like adaptive thresholding, histogram equalization, and multilingual OCR support can further refine the system, making it adaptable to various lighting conditions and regional license plate designs.
Handling obscured license plates in Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) systems requires advanced image processing and deep learning techniques to enhance visibility and accuracy. Obscured plates may result from poor lighting, motion blur, dirt, or partial occlusion. To address these challenges, preprocessing techniques like adaptive thresholding, histogram equalization, and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) can enhance the plate's visibility by adjusting contrast and brightness dynamically. Image restoration methods, such as deblurring algorithms or inpainting, can reconstruct partially missing plate segments. For segmentation and detection, deep learning models like YOLO or SSD, trained on datasets with varied plate conditions, can effectively identify plates despite partial obstructions. Additionally, implementing robust OCR models fine-tuned for noisy or distorted text helps in accurate character extraction. Combining these techniques creates a resilient ANPR system capable of handling obscured plates in real-world scenarios.
